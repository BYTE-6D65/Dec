# The Case for Tiling Interfaces

The web has largely been defined by the scrolling document model. While effective for long-form text, it often falls short for complex applications.

## Tiling Window Managers

Tiling window managers (TWMs) like i3, sway, and yabai offer a different paradigm:
- Non-overlapping windows
- Maximum screen utilization
- Keyboard-centric navigation

## Applying to the Web

By adopting these principles, we can create web interfaces that feel more like productivity tools and less like brochures.
